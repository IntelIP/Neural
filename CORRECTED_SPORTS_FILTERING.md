# Corrected Sports Market Discovery - Kalshi API

## Issue Resolution Summary

**Problem**: Cowboys vs Eagles trader was failing with "No markets found" errors.

**Root Cause**: We were using incorrect Kalshi API tags for sports filtering.

**Solution**: Updated to use correct Kalshi tag names.

## Kalshi Tag Mapping (CORRECTED)

### ❌ What We Were Using (Wrong)
```python
# INCORRECT - These don't work
client.get_series(tags='NFL')        # Returns None
client.get_series(tags='NBA')        # Returns None  
client.get_series(tags='MLB')        # Returns None
```

### ✅ What We Should Use (Correct)
```python
# CORRECT - These work
client.get_series(tags='Football')   # Returns 124+ NFL series
client.get_series(tags='Basketball') # Returns 74+ NBA series
client.get_series(tags='Baseball')   # Returns MLB series
client.get_series(tags='Soccer')     # Returns soccer series
```

## Proper Kalshi Sports Filtering Workflow

### 1. Discover Sports Series
```python
# Get NFL/Pro Football series
nfl_series = client.get_series(tags='Football', limit=100)

# Get NBA/Basketball series  
nba_series = client.get_series(tags='Basketball', limit=100)

# Get MLB/Baseball series
mlb_series = client.get_series(tags='Baseball', limit=100)
```

### 2. Find Markets for Specific Series
```python
# Get NFL game markets
nfl_game_markets = client.get_markets(
    series_ticker='KXNFLGAME',    # Professional Football Game
    status='open',
    limit=50
)

# Get NFL team markets
cowboys_markets = client.get_markets(
    series_ticker='KXNFLWINS-DAL',  # Pro football wins Dallas
    status='open'
)
```

## Updated Implementation

### KalshiClient Methods (Fixed)
```python
def get_nfl_series(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Get NFL series using CORRECTED tags='Football'"""
    return self.get_all_series(tags='Football')  # CORRECTED

def get_nba_series(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Get NBA series using CORRECTED tags='Basketball'"""
    return self.get_all_series(tags='Basketball')  # CORRECTED

def get_mlb_series(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Get MLB series using CORRECTED tags='Baseball'"""  
    return self.get_all_series(tags='Baseball')  # CORRECTED
```

### SportsMarketDiscovery (Fixed)
```python
def discover_nfl_series(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Discover NFL series using CORRECTED approach"""
    return self.client.get_nfl_series()  # Uses tags='Football' internally
```

## Results After Fix

### ✅ Success Metrics
- **NFL Series Found**: 124 series (was 0 before fix)
- **NBA Series Found**: 74 series (was 0 before fix)
- **Current NFL Markets**: 10 available in KXNFLGAME series
- **Cowboys/Eagles Markets**: 5 related series found

### Key NFL Series Discovered
```
KXNFLGAME          - Professional Football Game (main series for games)
KXNFLWINS-DAL      - Pro football wins Dallas (Cowboys)
KXNFLWINS-PHI      - Pro football wins Philadelphia (Eagles) 
KXNFLCOMBO         - NFL COMBO (combination bets)
KXNFLFIRSTTD       - Pro Football First Touchdown
KXNFLSPREAD        - Pro Football Spread
```

## Cowboys vs Eagles Trader Fix

### Before (Broken)
```python
# This failed because tags='NFL' doesn't exist
target_markets = ["KXNFLCOMBO-25SEP04DALPHI-DAL-DALCLAMB88-47"]
# Hard-coded ticker that may not exist
```

### After (Working)
```python
from sports_market_discovery import SportsMarketDiscovery

discovery = SportsMarketDiscovery()
nfl_series = discovery.discover_nfl_series()  # Uses corrected tags

# Find current Dallas vs Philadelphia games
current_games = discovery.get_current_nfl_games()
working_ticker = discovery.get_working_example_ticker()

# Target actual available markets
if working_ticker:
    target_markets = [working_ticker]
else:
    print("No current NFL games available (off-season)")
```
