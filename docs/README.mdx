# üöÄ Welcome to Neural SDK

<Note>
**READ THIS FIRST:** This documentation will teach you EXACTLY how to collect sports market data and execute trades. No guessing. No ambiguity. Just working code.
</Note>

## üì¶ What Is Neural SDK?

Think of Neural SDK as **three big LEGO boxes** that snap together:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="üìä Data Collection Stack" icon="database">
    Pull market data from Kalshi, ESPN, and other sources
  </Card>
  <Card title="üí∞ Trading Infrastructure" icon="coins">
    Check your portfolio, place orders, manage risk
  </Card>
  <Card title="üèà Sports Markets Toolkit" icon="football">
    Find NFL, NBA, and college games with correct tickers
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## ‚ö° Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Neural SDK

```bash
pip install neural-sdk
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Credentials

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
KALSHI_API_KEY_ID=your_key_here
KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=secrets/kalshi_private.pem
```

<Warning>
**COMMON MISTAKE #1:** Using `KALSHI_API_KEY` instead of `KALSHI_API_KEY_ID`
The correct variable is `KALSHI_API_KEY_ID` (with _ID at the end)
</Warning>

### Step 3: Test It Works

```python
from neural.data_collection import get_game_markets
import asyncio

async def test():
    # Get Thursday Night Football (Seahawks vs Cardinals)
    df = await get_game_markets("KXNFLGAME-25SEP25SEAARI")
    print(f"Found {len(df)} markets")
    print(df[['ticker', 'title', 'yes_ask', 'no_ask']])

asyncio.run(test())
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Found 2 markets
ticker                          title                    yes_ask  no_ask
KXNFLGAME-25SEP25SEAARI-SEA    Seattle at Arizona Winner?   50      51
KXNFLGAME-25SEP25SEAARI-ARI    Seattle at Arizona Winner?   51      50
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Things to Know

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="üî¥ Sports Tickers Are NOT What You Think">
    **WRONG:** `series_ticker="NFL"` or `"Pro Football"`

    **RIGHT:** `series_ticker="KXNFLGAME"`

    The actual tickers are prefixed with KX:
    - NFL ‚Üí `KXNFLGAME`
    - NBA ‚Üí `KXNBA`
    - College Football ‚Üí `KXNCAAFGAME`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="üü° Status Filters Will Hide Markets">
    **WRONG:** `status="open"` (hides most games)

    **RIGHT:** `status=None` (shows all games)

    Games can be "active", "closed", "finalized" - not just "open"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="üü¢ Event Tickers Follow a Pattern">
    Pattern: `KXNFLGAME-[DATE][TEAM1][TEAM2]`

    Example: `KXNFLGAME-25SEP22DETBAL`
    - `KXNFLGAME` = NFL game prefix
    - `25SEP22` = September 22, 2025
    - `DET` = Detroit
    - `BAL` = Baltimore
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
