description: Neural architecture and module layout
---

Neural provides a clean, modular architecture to build trading systems on prediction markets. The platform is organized into three stacks:

## Stacks

### 1) Data Collection (neural.data_collection)

Purpose: Collect historical and real-time market data
Includes:
- Kalshi API sources and helpers
- REST and WebSocket utilities
- Transformers and a registry

**Example:**

```python
from neural.data_collection import KalshiApiSource, get_all_sports_markets

source = KalshiApiSource()
markets = get_all_sports_markets()
```

### 2) Analysis (neural.analysis)

Purpose: Research, backtest, risk, and execution modeling
Includes:
- Backtester
- Strategy base and examples
- Risk utilities (kelly_criterion, etc.)
- Order management helpers

**Example:**

```python
from neural.analysis import Backtester

strategy = ...  # Your Strategy subclass
engine = Backtester(strategy, initial_capital=10_000)
results = engine.run(historical_data)
```

### 3) Trading (neural.trading)

Purpose: Execute orders with production-ready clients
Includes:
- TradingClient (modern kalshi client wrapper with DI)
- REST, WebSocket, and FIX integrations
- Proxies for portfolio, markets, exchange

**Example:**

```python
from neural.trading import TradingClient

client = TradingClient()
order = client.exchange.place_order(ticker="EXAMPLE", side="yes", count=100, price=55)
```

## Design Principles

- Clear public APIs via `__all__` in each package
- Environment-first credential loading with helpful errors
- DI-friendly trading client with lazy imports for optional deps
- Integration tests skip when credentials are absent for reliable CI
