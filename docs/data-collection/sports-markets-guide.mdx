title: Sports Markets Guide
description: Explore and query sports-related markets
---

This guide demonstrates finding sports markets using the data collection stack.

## Example

```python
from neural.data_collection import KalshiApiSource, get_all_sports_markets

source = KalshiApiSource()
markets = get_all_sports_markets()

print(f"Found {len(markets)} sports markets")
for m in markets[:5]:
    print(m.get("ticker"), m.get("title"))
```

**Notes:**

- Functions return plain dict-like structures, ready for Pandas or further transformations.
- Use transformers to normalize or aggregate as needed.
