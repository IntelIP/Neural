## 🎯 **Key Functionality Tested**

### **WebSocket Management**
- ✅ Connection and disconnection
- ✅ Market subscription and unsubscription
- ✅ Connection status tracking
- ✅ Error handling for connection failures

### **Event Handling**
- ✅ Decorator-based event registration (`@websocket.on_market_data`)
- ✅ Multiple event types (market data, trades, connections, errors)
- ✅ Event filtering by ticker patterns and price ranges
- ✅ Priority-based handler execution
- ✅ Global event handlers

### **SDK Integration**
- ✅ WebSocket creation via `sdk.create_websocket()`
- ✅ NFL stream creation via `sdk.create_nfl_stream()`
- ✅ Integrated streaming via `sdk.start_streaming()`
- ✅ Handler registration via SDK decorators
- ✅ Automatic handler forwarding to WebSocket

### **Market-Specific Features**
- ✅ NFL market filtering and subscription
- ✅ Team-specific market handlers
- ✅ Ticker pattern matching (e.g., 'NFL-*')
- ✅ Game-specific market grouping

## 🏗️ **Test Architecture**

### **Mock-Based Testing**
- Used mock objects to avoid data pipeline dependencies
- Tested core functionality without external network calls
- Focused on API contracts and integration points

### **Test Categories**
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
3. **Workflow Tests**: End-to-end user scenarios

### **Coverage Areas**
- ✅ Initialization and configuration
- ✅ Connection management
- ✅ Event handling and dispatching
- ✅ Error conditions and edge cases
- ✅ SDK integration points

## 🚀 **Testing Strategy**

### **Dependency Isolation**
- Mocked `data_pipeline` modules to avoid import errors
- Created simplified test doubles for core functionality
- Focused on testing SDK interface contracts

### **Async Testing**
- Used `pytest-asyncio` for testing async functionality
- Tested WebSocket connection lifecycle
- Tested event handler execution

### **Real-World Scenarios**
- Tested complete user workflows
- Tested error handling and recovery
- Tested concurrent operations

## 📈 **Test Results Analysis**
